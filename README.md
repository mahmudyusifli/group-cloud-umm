This project made by 3 students for Applied system software class. Project is Connect4 game. Connect4 is a two-player game where the objective is to connect
four tokens in a row before the opponent. It's a game of
strategy, and understanding the basics is crucial to winning. More specifically, 
Connect 4 is a classic board game that combines strategy, planning, and a bit of luck. The objective of the game is to be the first player to connect a line of four of their colored tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal pattern on the game board.
Game Setup:
The game is played on a vertical grid consisting of six rows and seven columns, resulting in 42 slots for tokens.
Two players participate, each assigned a colorâ€”usually red and yellow.
The empty game board is placed horizontally, and players take turns placing their colored tokens into the slots from the top.
Gameplay:
Players alternate turns, starting with one player and then moving to the other.
On their turn, a player selects a column and drops their token into the lowest available slot of that column.
The token will occupy the lowest empty slot in the selected column, effectively "falling" to the bottom of the column due to gravity.
Once a token is placed, it cannot be moved or removed from the game board.
Winning Condition:
The game continues until one player successfully forms a line of four of their colored tokens.
A line can be formed either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The line must consist of four consecutive tokens of the same color, with no gaps or interruptions by the opponent's tokens.
If a player manages to connect four tokens before their opponent does, they win the game.
If all 42 slots on the game board are filled without a winner, the game is considered a draw.In
this presentation, we'll go over some key strategies to help you
